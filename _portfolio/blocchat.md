## Bloc chat

Bloc Chat is a chat room application I worked on as one of my front end project using React. Since the Bloc Chat also required the use of a database, I was introduced to utilizing Google Firebase to help store the chat room conversations.

Working on the Bloc Chat Project was definitely challenging since React was still new to me in addition to learning to have my codes interact with Firebase. Although I relied on project checkpoints to assist me through the projects, the Bloc Chat project was different since I needed to track down my own solutions by going through React documentations, and other sources. My code for this project is available on my [GitHub Page.](https://github.com/almendoza25)
