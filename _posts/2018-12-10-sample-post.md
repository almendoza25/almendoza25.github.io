title: Goal as a Developer
---
After about 5 years of working in the marketing world, I decided last year that I would like to transition back into the software development world. Before joining the marketing team at 24 Hour Fitness 5 years ago, I was in the mobile gaming industry as a QA Engineer and did a bit of Mobile iOS Development and PHP/Java/Web Development. One thing that I noticed about myself is that even after entering the marketing department, I would always buy some kind of programming book or a programming course in Udemy just to satify my strong curiosity with the latest tech/programming trends. Joining the Bloc program is definitely a big decision for me and a significant turning point of my career. My current goal is to master a few programming languages/Frameworks such as Ruby/JavaScript/Angular/React/iOS/Swift and enter back into the development workforce. Going forward in my career, I would like to keep
 on continuing to learn about other programming languages while still mastering my current skills.
